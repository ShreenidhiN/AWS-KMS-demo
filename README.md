# AWS-KMS-demo
**AWS Key Management Service** (KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and manage keys and control the use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services.

In this python code, a text file is encrypted using the key and then decrypted using the key to obtain the original text in the file. This can be further improved for different types of files and inputs.

Steps covered :
  1. Install/import essential libraries
  2. Define access and secret keys of AWS account
  3. Create KMS key
  4. Create Data key
  5. Test using a text file
      1. Encryption
      2. Decryption

Also, delete all the resources after use as it would be charged!
